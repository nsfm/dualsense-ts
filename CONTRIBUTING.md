### Operating System

The project and tools have been tested on these operating systems:

- Arch Linux x64 (kernel 5.16.15 onwards)
- Ubuntu 20.04.4 x64

If your system isn't covered here and everything works, please open a PR and let us know!

### Dependencies

This project prefers to maintain a minimal dependency footprint within the final build.

- `dependencies` will face scrutiny; they should demonstrate significant value and come from a stable source.
- `optionalDependencies` are preferred over `dependencies`.
- `devDependencies` should simplify or improve the dev experience.

### PR Merge Requirements

- CI checks must pass
- Test coverage maintained where appropriate
- Change should improve the repo :+1:
