## Roadmap

If you'd like to help complete these features, please reach out on github!

#### Managing multiple controllers

- Wait for new devices
- Reconnect automatically when a device is lost
- Devices are fingerprinted to ensure reconnection is consistent

#### Indicator & haptics scripting

More tools for providing nuanced, multi-dimensional feedback to the user.

#### Input smoothing

Use virtual inputs to get debounced or time-averaged values.

#### Idle sensing

Use the gyroscope and accelerometer to check whether the controller is resting on a surface or if all inputs have been idle for some time.
